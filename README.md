# Employee-Tracker
the purpose of this assignment was to create a node.js app that was able to run in the terminal. The created app should be able to at the minimum create an employee and send them into a database. I had trouble setting up my foreign keys and I never really got to create anything. I got help from other classmates and was unable to find and solve the problem im running in to.
